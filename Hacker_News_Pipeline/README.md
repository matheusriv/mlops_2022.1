# Guided project: hacker news pipeline

In this guided project, we use the pipeline we have been building in the 'Building a Data Pipeline' course of Dataquest, and apply it to a real world data pipeline project. From a JSON API, we filter, clean, aggregate, and summarize data in a sequence of tasks that apply these transformations for us.
