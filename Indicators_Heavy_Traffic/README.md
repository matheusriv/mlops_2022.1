# Guided Project: Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

Throughout the 'Data Visualization Fundamentals' course of Dataquest, we focused only on exploratory data visualization and learned the following:

* How to visualize time series data with line plots.
* How to visualize correlations with scatter plots.
* How to visualize frequency distributions with bar plots and histograms.
* How to speed up our exploratory data visualization workflow with the pandas library.
* How to compare graphs using grid charts.

To make learning smoother and more efficient, we learned about each of these topics in isolation. In this guided project, we'll go one step further and learn to combine these skills.

We're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.
